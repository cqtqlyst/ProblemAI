        "problem": "A car is traveling along a straight road at a constant velocity of 60 mph. How far will the car travel in 3 hours?",
        "solution": "To find the distance traveled, we multiply the velocity by the time: 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles. Therefore, the car will travel 180 miles in 3 hours."

        "problem": "A tank contains 500 gallons of water. Water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 10 gallons per minute, while water is being drained from the tank at a rate of 5 gallons per minute. After how many minutes will the tank be half full?",
        "solution": "Let's denote the time in minutes as 't'. The rate of water being pumped in is 10 gallons/minute and the rate of water being drained is 5 gallons/minute. The net rate of change of water in the tank is 10 - 5 = 5 gallons/minute. We can set up the following equation: 500 + 5t = (1/2)(500). Solving for 't', we find t = 50 minutes. Therefore, the tank will be half full after 50 minutes."

        "problem": "A rocket is launched vertically into the air. Its height above the ground at time 't' seconds is given by the function h(t) = -16t^2 + 64t + 80. Find the time it takes for the rocket to reach its maximum height.",
        "solution": "To find the time it takes for the rocket to reach its maximum height, we need to find the vertex of the parabolic function h(t) = -16t^2 + 64t + 80. The vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula x = -b / (2a). In this case, a = -16 and b = 64. Plugging in these values, we get t = -64 / (2*(-16)) = 2 seconds. Therefore, it takes the rocket 2 seconds to reach its maximum height."

        "problem": "A company produces and sells widgets. The production cost, in dollars, for 'x' widgets is given by the function C(x) = 1000 + 5x^2, while the revenue, in dollars, for 'x' widgets is given by the function R(x) = 20x. Find the number of widgets the company must sell to break even.",
        "solution": "To find the number of widgets the company must sell to break even, we need to find the value of 'x' for which the cost equals the revenue. Setting C(x) = R(x), we get 1000 + 5x^2 = 20x. Rearranging the equation, we have 5x^2 - 20x + 1000 = 0. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a). Plugging in the values, we get x = (20 ± √(20^2 - 4*5*1000)) / (2*5). Simplifying, we find x ≈ 14.14 or x ≈ 5.86. Since the number of widgets must be a whole number, the company must sell 15 widgets to break even."

        "solution": "To find the limit of the function as x approaches 2, we can directly substitute 2 into the function: f(2) = 3(2)^2 - 2(2) + 1 = 12 - 4 + 1 = 9. Therefore, the limit of the function as x approaches 2 is 9. The correct answer is B."

        "solution": "To find the limit of the sequence as n approaches infinity, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by the highest power of n in the expression, which is n^2. This gives us a_n = (3 + 2/n - 1/n^2) / (1 + 1/n). Taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the terms with 2/n and 1/n^2 become negligible compared to the dominant terms. Therefore, the limit simplifies to 3/1 = 3. The correct answer is A."
