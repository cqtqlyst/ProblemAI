    "question": "Given the function (f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7), find the critical points and determine whether they are relative minima, relative maxima, or saddle points.",
    "solution": "To find the critical points, we take the derivative of (f(x)) and set it to zero. The derivative is (f'(x) = 9x^2 - 4x + 5). Setting it to zero and solving for (x), we get the critical points (x = \frac{2 pm isqrt{26}}{9}). Since the derivative is always positive, we can conclude that the critical points are neither relative minima nor relative maxima. They are saddle points.",

    "solution": "The particle changes direction when its velocity changes sign. The velocity function is (v(t) = 6t^2 - 18t + 12). Setting (v(t) = 0) and solving for (t), we get the time (t = 1) and (t = 2). By examining the sign of (v(t)) in the intervals ((- infty, 1)), ((1, 2)), and ((2, infty)), we find that the particle changes direction at (t = 1) and (t = 2).",

By finding the antiderivative of the integrand and evaluating it at the limits, we get (lim_{{b \to infty}} lnleft|\frac{b^3 + 4b}{3 + 2b^2}\right| - lnleft|\frac{1^3 + 4}{3 + 2}\right| = ln(1) - ln(\frac{5}{5}) = 0). Thus, the improper integral evaluates to 0.",

    "solution": "Let (x) be the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder, and (y) be the height of the ladder on the wall. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have (x^2 + y^2 = 20^2). Differentiating both sides with respect to time, we get (2x\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt} = 0). At the given moment, when (x = 16) feet, we have (y = sqrt{20^2 - 16^2} = 12) feet. We are given (\frac{dx}{dt} = 2) feet per second. Plugging in the values, we can solve for (\frac{dy}{dt}) and find that the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of (-\frac{8}{3}) feet per second.",
