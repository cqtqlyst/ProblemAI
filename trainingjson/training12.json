        "problem": "The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 was a tragic event. Describe the sequence of events that led to the sinking of the Titanic and its impact on maritime safety.",
        "solution": "The sinking of the RMS Titanic occurred on April 15, 1912, after the ship struck an iceberg. The sequence of events leading to the sinking included:\n\n1. Collision: The Titanic, considered unsinkable, struck an iceberg at 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912, during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.\n2. Insufficient Lifeboats: The Titanic had lifeboats for only about half of its passengers and crew, as regulations at the time were based on ship tonnage rather than the number of people on board.\n3. Evacuation: The evacuation process was chaotic and poorly organized, leading to the loss of many lives. Women and children were given priority, but some lifeboats were not fully loaded.\n4. Radio Communication: The distress signals sent by the Titanic's wireless operators reached nearby ships, but some did not respond promptly.\n\nImpact on Maritime Safety:\n\nThe sinking of the Titanic had a profound impact on maritime safety. It led to several changes, including:\n\n- The International Ice Patrol: This organization was established to monitor and report iceberg locations to prevent similar accidents.\n- SOLAS Convention: The sinking prompted the development of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which set safety regulations for all ships.\n- Lifeboat Requirements: Ships were required to carry enough lifeboats for all passengers and crew.\n\nThe tragic loss of life on the Titanic raised awareness about the need for better safety measures at sea and significantly influenced maritime regulations."

        "problem": "The concept of natural selection is a fundamental principle in biology. Explain the process of natural selection, providing examples to illustrate its role in the evolution of species.",
        "solution": "Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. It involves the process through which certain heritable traits become more or less common in a population over time based on their adaptability to the environment. Here's how natural selection works:\n\n1. Variation: Within a population, individuals exhibit genetic variation, leading to differences in traits such as color, size, or behavior.\n2. Differential Survival and Reproduction: In a particular environment, some traits may provide advantages, making individuals better suited for survival and reproduction. These individuals will have more offspring, passing on the advantageous traits to the next generation.\n3. Heredity: The advantageous traits are inherited by the offspring, leading to an increased prevalence of those traits in subsequent generations.\n\nExample of Natural Selection:\n\nOne classic example of natural selection is the peppered moth in England during the Industrial Revolution. Before the revolution, most peppered moths had light-colored wings, which provided camouflage against light-colored tree bark. However, as industrialization increased, pollution darkened the tree bark, making the light-colored moths more visible to predators.\n\nIn this changed environment, a small number of moths had dark-colored wings due to genetic variation. These dark moths had a survival advantage, as they were better camouflaged against the darkened tree bark. Over time, the proportion of dark-colored moths in the population increased significantly, demonstrating natural selection in action.\n\nNatural selection plays a crucial role in the adaptation and evolution of species, allowing them to better survive and reproduce in their respective environments."

        ],
        "solution": "Additive color mixing involves combining different colors of light to create new colors. The three primary colors in additive color mixing are Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). When all three primary colors are combined at full intensity, they produce white light.\n\nThe correct answer is D. Yellow. Yellow is not one of the primary colors in additive color mixing."

        ],
        "solution": "The author of the novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is B. Harper Lee. The novel, published in 1960, is a classic work of American literature that addresses themes of racism, social injustice, and moral growth."

        "problem": "Define 'Quantum Mechanics' and explain its significance in the field of physics.",
        "solution": "Quantum Mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. It describes the fundamental nature of particles, such as electrons and photons, and their interactions.\n\nSignificance in Physics:\n\nQuantum Mechanics is of immense significance in the field of physics due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Particle Behavior: Classical physics fails to explain certain phenomena at the atomic and subatomic levels. Quantum Mechanics, however, successfully describes the wave-particle duality of particles, where they exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.\n2. Uncertainty Principle: Quantum Mechanics introduced Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously measure certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) of a particle with absolute precision.\n3. Quantum States and Superposition: Quantum Mechanics introduced the concept of quantum states and superposition. A particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured, leading to intriguing possibilities for quantum computing and information processing.\n4. Quantum Entanglement: Quantum Mechanics predicted quantum entanglement, where two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, regardless of distance.\n5. Foundation for Modern Technology: Quantum Mechanics is the basis for many modern technologies, such as transistors, lasers, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n6. Quantum Field Theory: Quantum Mechanics is a foundational framework for Quantum Field Theory, which extends its principles to describe interactions between particles and fields.\n\nQuantum Mechanics revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world and laid the groundwork for many technological advancements. It remains one of the most successful and accurate theories in physics."
