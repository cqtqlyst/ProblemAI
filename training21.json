        "solution": "To calculate the molarity of the solution, we use the formula: Molarity (M) = moles of solute / volume of solution in liters. Given that the moles of potassium chloride (KCl) is 0.5 moles and the volume of the solution is 500 mL (0.5 liters), we get: Molarity (M) = 0.5 moles / 0.5 liters = 1 M. Therefore, the molarity of the solution is 1 M."
